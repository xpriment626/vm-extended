# Overview

`vm-extended` is a set of functions designed specifically to work with mainnet forks with - eth, arbitrum, optimism, polygon currently supported.

The idea of these functions is to make testing token and nft interactions easy, without needing to write up any mocks of your own. This contract also comes with uniswap v2/v3 router and factory addresses out of the box, as well as a pure function that returns a WETH token address relative to the chain being tested on.
